# Project Overview

Welcome to the project repository!

This repository is structured to help with testing and development. Below is a brief overview of each folder and its purpose:

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **`Core VS-version - Testing/`**
  - Contains Visual Studio project files (`.sln`) used for testing the core modules in a development environment.

- **`releases/`**
  - This folder contains **executable files** for each module.  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** These executables are intended **only for testing purposes**.
  - It is **strongly recommended** to run these in a **sandboxed environment** (e.g., VM, container) to avoid unintended system changes.
  - Running these executables outside a sandbox may result in **permanent installation without the actual core**, potentially causing system issues or incomplete functionality.

- **`src/`**
  - This directory contains the actual **core source code**.  
  - Use this for reference, development, or building your own custom versions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

This project is under active testing. Do **not** use the executables in a production environment unless you fully understand the risks involved.

For any issues or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project.
